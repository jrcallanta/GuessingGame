## Intro
This is a basic guessing game. Provide a range, and the game will generate a random number. Guess the number to win! Push your intuition further by providing an optional attempt limit.

## How To Play
Make sure to have python3 installed. From the directory, run one of the following commands:
```
python3 main.py <UPPERBOUND>
```
```
python3 main.py <LOWERBOUND> <UPPERBOUND>
```
```
python3 main.py <LOWERBOUND> <UPPERBOUND> <ATTEMPT_LIMIT>
```
-  LOWERBOUND: the lowest number in range, inclusive
-  UPPERBOUND: the higest number in range, inclusive.
-  ATTEMPT_LIMT: the amount of attempts you have to guess.
